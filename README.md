Project Description:
The "Simple Phonebook Application" is a console-based program written in C++ that allows users to manage their contacts efficiently. The application provides a menu-driven interface, enabling users to create, edit, delete, search, and list contacts. Each contact consists of essential information such as first name, last name, phone number, and additional notes.

Key Features:

Create Contacts: Users can create new contacts by entering their first name, last name, phone number, and notes. The application supports up to 100 contacts.

Edit Contacts: Existing contacts can be edited individually. Users can update their first name, last name, phone number, and notes.

Delete Contacts: Contacts can be deleted from the phonebook. The application prompts the user for confirmation before deletion.

Search Contacts: Users can search for contacts by providing a search string. The application searches through the contacts' first names, last names, phone numbers, and notes to find matches.

List Contacts: The application provides an option to list all non-empty contacts stored in the phonebook. Users can review the contact information, including phone numbers and notes.

Interactive Interface: The application uses a simple and user-friendly menu-driven interface that guides users through their actions.
